# `GO Authentication Backend`

A web server backend with complete JWT user authentication, written in GO.

## Stack

1. GO: programming language
2. JWT: authentication strategy
3. PostgreSQL: primary database
4. Render: cloud hosting platform

## Running locally

Before you can run the server locally, you need to create a .env file which stores most of the server's private configurations. An example env file shows all the parameters required, then the server can be run by using the command:

```bash
  go run server.go
```
